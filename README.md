Responsivo is a simple, minimalistic site that allows you preview a website on different mobile devices.

It is the equivalent of using the developer tools to check the default Galaxy phone, Iphone and Ipad's views, but with a lot less clicking around.

Responsivo works on published sites and localhost.
